- uid: System.Dynamic.DynamicMetaObject
  href: System.Dynamic.DynamicMetaObject.yml

  type: Class
  summary: Represents the dynamic binding and a binding logic of an object participating in the dynamic binding.
- uid: System.Dynamic.DynamicMetaObjectBinder
  href: System.Dynamic.DynamicMetaObjectBinder.yml
  name: DynamicMetaObjectBinder
  type: Class
  summary: The dynamic call site binder that participates in the [System.Dynamic.DynamicMetaObject](System.Dynamic.DynamicMetaObject.yml) binding protocol.
- uid: System.Dynamic.DynamicObject
  href: System.Dynamic.DynamicObject.yml
  name: DynamicObject
  type: Class
  summary: >-
    Provides a simple class that can be inherited from to create an object with dynamic behavior

    at runtime.  Subclasses can override the various binder methods (GetMember, SetMember, Call, etc...)

    to provide custom behavior that will be invoked at runtime.



    If a method is not overridden then the DynamicObject does not directly support that behavior and

    the call site will determine how the binding should be performed.
- uid: System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject
  href: System.Dynamic.ExpandoObject.yml
  name: ExpandoObject
  type: Class
  summary: Represents an object with members that can be dynamically added and removed at runtime.
- uid: System.Dynamic.GetIndexBinder
  href: System.Dynamic.GetIndexBinder.yml
  name: GetIndexBinder
  type: Class
  summary: Represents the dynamic get index operation at the call site, providing the binding semantic and the details about the operation.
- uid: System.Dynamic.GetMemberBinder
  href: System.Dynamic.GetMemberBinder.yml
  name: GetMemberBinder
  type: Class
  summary: Represents the dynamic get member operation at the call site, providing the binding semantic and the details about the operation.
- uid: System.Dynamic.IDynamicMetaObjectProvider
  href: System.Dynamic.IDynamicMetaObjectProvider.yml
  name: IDynamicMetaObjectProvider
  type: Interface
  summary: Represents a dynamic object, that can have its operations bound at runtime.
- uid: System.Dynamic.IInvokeOnGetBinder
  href: System.Dynamic.IInvokeOnGetBinder.yml
  name: IInvokeOnGetBinder
  type: Interface
  summary: >-
