    Only reading entries from the archive is permitted.

    If the underlying file or stream is seekable, then files will be read from the archive on-demand as they are requested.

    If the underlying file or stream is not seekable, the entire archive will be held in memory.

    Requires that the underlying file or stream is readable.

    Only supports the creation of new archives.

    Only writing to newly created entries in the archive is permitted.

    Each entry in the archive can only be opened for writing once.

    If only one entry is written to at a time, data will be written to the underlying stream or file as soon as it is available.

    The underlying stream must be writeable, but need not be seekable.
